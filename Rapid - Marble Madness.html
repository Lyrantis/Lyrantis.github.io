								<br> <p> The framework was very simple, capable of rolling a ball using WASD in 4 directions, if the ball reached the goal, it would move to the second level, which only
								contained a spawn point for the ball and a single half pipe leading to the goal. At which point the game would end and the player would be given a screen displaying their 
								score. We were tasked to add features to the game, with rapid games prototyping, the emphasis is on enhancing the framework with features not previously present, simple 
								game mechanics which could be easily implemented and it could be tested to see how enjoyable said feature is, due to the nature and purpose of prototyping, the efficiency 
								of code is not important, as long as it does the intended functions.<br /><br />

								<div style="float: left">

								</div>

								I started by getting a rough design for the second level, I had a look at the prefabs given and how I could use them, these were things like different level shapes, jump pads,
								 teleporters, spinning bars, moving platforms etc. I created a rough layout using these prefabs, and decided to align the level at a 45 degree angle so that the movement axis lined
								up with the screen and felt much smoother. The problem with this was an increased difficulty with depth perception.<br /><br />

								I decided to also improve the controls of the game, allowing for a jump, which would give me more options for platforming challenges, and a brake to help remain still on
								 moving platforms as I noticed they felt quite janky to move on and were not particularly enjoyable. I had to consider times when the player should/shouldnt be allowed to jump, 
								the brake strength, and when the player had stopped, which presented unique challenges.<br /><br />

								<div style="float: right">
									<img src="images/Marble Madness  - Third.png" />
								</div>

								I also created a door which only opened under a certain condition, for the second level, this was the ball's colour, for the third level which I also created, it requires 
								the player to collect a number of keys, each one was placed in a different part of the level that had a different challenge, making use of a different game mechanic such as the jump, 
								platforming sections that require a level of precision, or a series of teleporters linked together as to where only one would lead to the correct path, the rest were interlinked. This led to a level that was 
								longer due to the complexity. So I decided to increase the level timer to double it's original value, and implement a game over screen, disabling player movement when the time ran out.<br /><br />

								Through this module, I became much more familiar with the layout of the Unity engine, aswell as how to write scripts that can interact with one another. I also learnt the importance of 
								limiting ambition when it comes to prototyping, as it is too easy to envision the finished project and aim for that, whereas the purpose of the module is to test certain gameplay elements.
								I tested the enhanced controls, the platforming sections and areas that required relatively precise movements. In the end, I found that the extra controls were a nice touch, and the platforming
								sections were enjoyable, but precision was not an easy thing to get, and often these sections would feel too difficult. Also, the sections of game where the level was inline with the camera
								presented a surprising level of difficulty with depth persception, it became incredibly difficult to determine how far away things were, or when to jump at the edge of a platform. If I was
								to do it again, I think I would use jump pads for some sections as timing the jumps was difficult and not all that enjoyable.<br />
