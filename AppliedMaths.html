								<h2>  <strong>Applied Mathematics for Games</strong></h2>
								<p>One of the most memorable modules from my second year. We were tasked with creating a simple 3D scene using DirectX11, and programming efficient physics algorithms<br />
								    The version at submission included spacial partitioning, various interactions between different shaped objects, realistic resistance forces, and has a lot of room for future developments such as cloth physics</p>

								One of the major points of success in the project was the resistance force implementation: gravity, drag, friction etc. were all made with realism in mind, acting upon each object 
								in ways dependent on the object's properties, which coulf be manually set. These included density, volume, and how rough the object was. 
								This allowed objects to behave as expected when taken in isolation, a few issues arose when programming these, an interestign one was the need for a floor value for velocity,
								not having one meant that objects would infinitely move, just at incredibly low velocities. Another interesting issue was caused by the nature of debugging physics on
								an object with various forces acting, the introduction of new forces could cause issues that were hard to trace. To combat this, I disabled each force seperately, manually 
								seeing which pairs of forces caused unexpected behaviours, then tracing through code to find any errors, be they in terms of logic or syntax.<br /><br />

								Another point of interest was the collision system, objects were made more modular using rigid bodies, static meshes, and other components as you would expect from a modern game engine. 
								This again made debugging easier, but also made the program far more legible and logical. Colliders were added for each objec type, those being planes, boxes, spheres, and then the more advanced 
								oriented boxes and custom meshes. The simple collisions were very simple, except when finding collsions between different types - spheres and boxes required finding the closest point to a sphere on 
								the edge of a box, and determining if the distance to the centre of the sphere was less than the radius. If so, it was colliding, and forces would be appropriately applied. The main difficulty came from 
								oriented bounding boxes, or OBBs.

	The game also contained coins that would enter the stage when an enemy was defeated from the pipe on the same side as that enemy, these were all worth 800 points, but would not respawn when entering the pipe at the bottom of the screen,
	They would simply be removed. Scores for each player could be tracked at the top of the screen, either side of the Top current score, a combined total of the current leading players' scores. Scores were stored in an external scoreboard,
	any score related data was handled by a ScoreSystem singleton I created, The top score would be displayed, and after the players were killed, they would be taken to a screen where they could input their name and if they scored high enough,
	they were entered on the board. Only 5 scores are held at a time on the scoreboard, but were saved when exiting the program if there was any changes.<br /><br />

	Overall I had a fleshed out version of Mario Bros complete with a scoreboard, animations, sound effects, and multiplayer. I plan on working on this project in future as  Ithoroughly enjoyed the development of it, my next steps will be to
	add any of the original game's features that are not currently present, such as the fireballs, "SlipIce" enemies, and showcase/bonus stages. I believe I have left myself with an adaptable enough framework that this will not be a difficult task,
	once I have done this, I will add a single player feature, animations to menus, and some original features such as new enemies or powerups. I will then move onto creating more content based off of the infamous Nintendo games <br /><br />

	Overall Grade: 1st
