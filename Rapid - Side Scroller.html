								<h2>  <strong>Rapid - Side Scroller</strong></h2>
								<p>The second prototype for the Rapid Games Prototyping module was a scrolling shooter, with the option of horizontal, vertical,
								or a top down view that scrolled in each direction, we had to add features to create the shell of a game. I decided on a side scrolling
								shooter that got progressively harder with elements of procedural content generation.</p>

	The framework contained a camera that faced to a 2D backround, on it was a wasp which the player controlled, and a butterfly enemy. The player could move in all directions, was
	not restricted by the bounds of the screen and would die upon touching the butterfly. The game would continue running. The player could also use the mouse to shoot a stinger horizontally, which 
	was capable of colliding with the enemy, destroying both game objects.<br /><br />

	I chose the horizontal framework as it most closely followed my ambitions for the project. My overall idea was to take inspiration from Cuphead's "Run 'n' Gun" levels, 
	pitting the player against waves of enemies before finishing with a stronger boss enemy. I reigned this in a little bit to be in line with the requirements of the assessment, 
	and decided to focus on the run-up to the boss, rather than actually making a boss enemy. Instead, the game would get much harder as it went on so that eventually, 
	the player would fail and their score would be given.<br /><br />

	</div>

	In terms of code, I started by restricting the player's movements to remain on the screen, I then changed the Butterfly script so that it would be destroyed when offscreen to
	prevent unecessary memory usage. I then created an enemy spawner with a few parameters so I could alter how many enemies each wave spawned, how much time between each spawn, how
	long between waves etc. These were all made public so that later on, I could dynamically change them during runtime. The enemy spawner also had to move along with the camera to make sure
	enemies spawned in the correct place, regardless of how long the level had been running.<br /><br />

	I also felt the need to create a few more enemy archetypes, I started by using the ship asset with a script I wrote to shoot down on the player, this worked especially well when I learnt
	how to create a path, I implemented a system where, after a changeable amount of time, this enemy would spawn, and follow a path which itself, followed the camera as it moved, this allowed
	the illusiom of it using the screenbounds as limits, it shoots every few seconds. Again, this variable is changable to the requirements of the game. This interval between shots would shorten
	as the game continued until it reached a minimum value to prevent the game from being too unfair. I could have also made the enemy follow the player slowly from above and shoot when close enough.<br /><br />

	</div>

	After much more development, I was left with a simple 2D game that greatly resembled a bullet hell game that gets progressively harder as you play and includes sounds, animations, different enemy
	types, random generation, and an infinitely regenerating world that would store scores on a leaderboard and provide the player with an arcade style way of entering a name. I learnt a lot about
	managing memory in C++, aswell as how to use pointers, references and destructors to ensure there are no memory leaks. If I had more time, I would have liked to focus more on creating even more
	types of enemy, and more powerups than are currently present to deepen the gameplay.
