								<h2>  <strong>Multiplayer Games Programming</strong></h2>
								<p>This module aimed to demonstrate our ability to produce a simple 2D game using C# and Microsoft's .net framework, we learnt many important
								programming fundamentals such as thread-safe architecture, concurrency and network package encryption and transfer. The game itself was intended 
								to be relatively simple to allow more time to be spent on the networking architecture.</p>

									We were given a base framework to expand upon, consisting of a pong-like game, with some basic input controlled movement and blocks affected by physics, from this we could take
									our own initiative to decide what we wanted to make. I had a few ideas and after discussion with a lecturer decided on a tank combat game inspired by Wii Play's tanks game, 
									I would have up to four players connect to a lobby and have the ability to move and fire projectiles to damage eachother, a very simple gameloop that still required a lot of 
									consideration to play across a network, such as packet types and encryption strateges. 
								<p />

								<p>
									The first challenge I ran into was synchronising player movement across the network, this wasn't done already in the framework and was the first proper type of packet sent across 
									the network, after only the debug message packet created. This would simply contain a sender ID and a message, when introducing the movement packet, it became necessary to make 
									a family of packet classes inherting from a base packet with the essential data. The issue that arose was when the packet was received, the program did not know how to differentiate 
									between the packet types, to solve this, I simply added an enum to allow packet types to be recognised and casted accordingly. Doing this allowed the packets to essentially interpret their 
									structure internally by calling the relevant constructor. They were sent over the network as strings from a json file, this lent itself well to encryption, which will be discussed later on.
								<p />

								<p>
									Once the movement was synchronised, I was quite easily able to sync rotation, turret rotations and projectile positions etc. The next big challenge was down to the game mechanics themselves,
									scores, rounds, title screen etc. This was not the focus of the project so I didn't expand on this a great deal, however, using the built in C# frameworks such as Xna was a challenge at first due to the 
									framework's unusual design choices leading to unexpected behavviours that were hard to debug. Most of this time was spent modularising and structuring the framework to help make additions easier. I 
									initially planned on adding mines that could be placed by players, however this would not have added anything of worth to the scope of the framework, so ultimately I decided against it. I adde 
								<p />

								In the final version of the game at the submission date, I had three different enemy variants: Shellcreepers (Koopas): That moved left or right depending on where they spawned, worked their way down the screen,
								re-emerging at the top when they entered a pipe at the bottom. These were the simplest enemies, so I only awarded 800 points for defeating them. If they were flipped over, either by bumping into the platform from below,
								or by hitting the POW block, they could be kicked off the stage. If they were allowed to flip back over however, they would become angry, turning red and moving much faster.<br />

								The second enemy variant was the SideStepper: A crab that would move much like a Koopa until damaged, at which point it would enrage, moving twice as fast until hit again, where it would flip over and be able to be killed.
								This enemy would award 1000 points as it was tougher than the Koopa, but would only begin spawning in levels in stage 3 or above. I didn't run into many issues creating this enemy type, the only one I encountered was
								a need for enemy i-frames to prevent the player from hitting them twice in one bump, but this was simple to implement.<br />

								The third and final enmy was the FighterFly: Instead of just charging left or right, it would jump, only moving when in the air,, while relatively slow in comparison to the others, it required precise timing to damage
								as it could only be hit when it landed. Because of this, it only appears beginning at stage 5, and would award 1200 points.<br /><br />

								</div>

								The game also contained coins that would enter the stage when an enemy was defeated from the pipe on the same side as that enemy, these were all worth 800 points, but would not respawn when entering the pipe at the bottom of the screen,
								They would simply be removed. Scores for each player could be tracked at the top of the screen, either side of the Top current score, a combined total of the current leading players' scores. Scores were stored in an external scoreboard,
								any score related data was handled by a ScoreSystem singleton I created, The top score would be displayed, and after the players were killed, they would be taken to a screen where they could input their name and if they scored high enough,
								they were entered on the board. Only 5 scores are held at a time on the scoreboard, but were saved when exiting the program if there was any changes.<br /><br />

								Overall I had a fleshed out version of Mario Bros complete with a scoreboard, animations, sound effects, and multiplayer. I plan on working on this project in future as  Ithoroughly enjoyed the development of it, my next steps will be to
								add any of the original game's features that are not currently present, such as the fireballs, "SlipIce" enemies, and showcase/bonus stages. I believe I have left myself with an adaptable enough framework that this will not be a difficult task,
								once I have done this, I will add a single player feature, animations to menus, and some original features such as new enemies or powerups. I will then move onto creating more content based off of the infamous Nintendo games <br /><br />

								Overall Grade: 1st
